# Levenbergâ€“Marquardt Cruve fit
 nonlinear data fitting by LM algorithm method
 
 And it is easy way to used.
 
 first, modify on parameter.h followed by below
 
 1. input your target function, as like  f(x) = 'ax^2 + bx + c' and every partial derivative by parameter
 2. input your second derivative for your target function
 3. determind parameter number, data of length, max loop and lomda
 
 *** if the result is not idea, maybe input other lomda ***
 
 Second, modify on main.c :
 
 1. Data of X and Y (is inpendence)
